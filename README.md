# 1pw
A command-line reader for 1Password.opvault files

This tool is, of course, targeted at platforms where 1Password
is not available. It has been tested on Linux only.

Use Dropbox to sync your 1Password database. Only Dropbox
syncing will get the needed 1Password.opvault file onto your
Linux machine, the other sync technologies offered by 1Password
are not available from Linux.
